# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI1

## Tic-Tac-Toe project with AI using deep Machine learning

## Description
In this project, you'll write a game called Tic-Tac-Toe that you can play against your computer. The computer will have three levels of difficulty â€” easy, medium, and hard.

To begin with, let's write a program that knows how to work with coordinates and determine the state of the game.

The top-left cell will have the coordinates (1, 1) and the bottom-right cell will have the coordinates (3, 3), as shown in this table:

(1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3)
(2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3)
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3)

The program should ask the user to enter the coordinates of the cell where they want to make a move.

Keep in mind that the first coordinate goes from top to bottom, and the second coordinate goes from left to right. Also, notice that coordinates start with 1 and can be 1, 2, or 3.

But what if the user attempts to enter invalid coordinates? This could happen if they try to enter letters or symbols instead of numbers, or the coordinates of an already occupied cell. Your program needs to prevent these things from happening by checking the user's input and catching possible exceptions.
